# ALX Task Manager ‚Äî Capstone Project (Django + AI-native IDE)

## üîñ Project Title & Description

**Project Title:** Task Manager ‚Äî Smart Productivity for Developers

**Short Description:**
A modern, secure Task Manager built with Django and Django REST Framework that helps individual developers and small teams track, prioritize, and schedule work. The app includes AI-powered natural-language task creation, smart prioritization, and automated reminders ‚Äî all developed inside an AI-native IDE (e.g., Trae) to demonstrate an AI-assisted development workflow.

**Who it‚Äôs for:**

* Individual developers who want a lightweight, developer-focused task tracker.
* Small teams who need a simple collaborative task board with intelligent suggestions.

**Why it matters:**

* Demonstrates backend engineering fundamentals (REST APIs, auth, background jobs) while integrating AI features that improve UX and developer productivity.
* Serves as a showcase of building production-ready Django apps using AI-native tooling for code generation, testing, and documentation ‚Äî a perfect capstone for ‚ÄúAI for Developers.‚Äù

## AI Integration Strategy

This project purposely uses an **AI-native IDE** (Trae) plus external LLMs to accelerate development and demonstrate context-aware AI workflows. Below are the concrete areas and how AI will be used.

### 1) Code generation

**Goals:** scaffold features, speed up boilerplate, and produce tested code patterns.

**How:**

* Use Trae to auto-generate model/serializer/view scaffolds from short prompts.
* Example prompt for Trae (scaffold):

  * `"Create a Django app `tasks` with models: Task (title, description, due_date, priority, status). Add serializers, viewsets (ModelViewSet) with JWT auth, and router registration. Include README usage examples."`
* Use Trae to generate Dockerfile, docker-compose, and Celery config from prompts.
* For sensitive/complex code (auth, payments, security): ask the IDE to provide an explanation + unit tests.

**Safety & QA:** Always review generated code, run linters (flake8, ruff) and static analyzers (bandit) before merging.

---

### 2) Testing (unit & integration)

**Goals:** high test coverage for core business logic and API endpoints.

**How:**

* Use prompts to ask Trae/LLM to produce `pytest` test files for models, serializers, and viewsets.
* Example testing prompt:

  * `"Write pytest tests for Task model: verify default priority, status transitions, and serialization. Include factory fixtures and database rollback."`
* For integration tests: request scenarios that simulate user flows (signup ‚Üí create task ‚Üí set reminder ‚Üí complete task).
* Use the AI to generate property-based tests or fuzz inputs for edge cases.

**Verification:** AI writes tests, developer runs them locally/CI and reviews failures; iterate until green.

---

### 3) Documentation

**Goals:** maintain clear docstrings, inline comments, and keep README updated automatically.

**How:**

* Use Trae to generate and update docstrings for functions and classes based on code context. Prompt examples:

  * `"Generate a concise docstring for this TaskViewSet explaining endpoints and permission model."`
* Use AI to auto-generate README sections from code (e.g., `API Endpoints` list) and to keep changelogs.
* Use docstring templates in prompts to enforce standard format (Args / Returns / Raises / Examples).

**Output:** store generated docs in `docs/` and add a GitHub Action that runs a doc-snippet generator on PR.

---

### 4) Context-aware techniques (feeding context into AI)

**Goals:** make AI suggestions accurate by providing relevant project context.

**How:**

* Feed the AI the project `file tree` when asking it to modify or extend code (so it knows where to place files).
* Provide `API spec` (OpenAPI/Swagger) JSON or `urls.py` outputs when asking the AI to write client code.
* When requesting bug fixes or refactors, pass `git diff` or file contents as part of the prompt so the AI can reason about the change in-situ.
* In Trae, use the IDE's code context window + selection to limit AI's scope.

**Practical examples:**

* Prompt: `"Given this file tree: apps/tasks/models.py, apps/tasks/serializers.py, apps/users/models.py ‚Äî add a Task serializer field `owner\_email` that is read-only and include tests. Here are the current file contents: <paste>"`
* Prompt for migration-aware changes: include `migrations/` list and model changes so AI can propose migration steps.
